# barreltracker
A web app designed to assist breweries in adding, editing, and being notified of barrels in the brewery.

Built with Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, Python, and Django, Barrel Tracker utilizes a user authentication system 
and SQLite3 to store and manage data for each user. 

To access the code, navigate to the tracker folder => select any of the .py files, as well as any files inside the 
static/tracker or template/tracker folders.
